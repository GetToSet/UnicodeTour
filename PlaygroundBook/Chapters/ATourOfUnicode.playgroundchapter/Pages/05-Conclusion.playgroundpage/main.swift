# Conclusion

In this book, we've explored some basic and fun aspects of Unicode. This book only scratched the surface of Unicode. There are far more knowledge and advanced topics regarding Unicode, such as comparison, sorting, collation, rendering and much more.

**CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean)** character encoding and representations, which we have not covered in this book, is extremely complex. Unicode's specific solution to CJK is called **Han unification** (Unihan), which may worth another whole book to illustrate.

Unicode is a complex but yet a graceful design in the field of software engineering, that, most of us may not realize. It lays the foundation for text representation and rendering, which is the fundamental of digital experience and linguistic researches.
