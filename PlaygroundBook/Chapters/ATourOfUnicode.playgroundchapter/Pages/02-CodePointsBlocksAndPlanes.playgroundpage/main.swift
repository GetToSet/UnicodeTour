# Code Points, Blocks and Planes

## How Unicode Organizes Characters

Unicode organizes characters into 17 planes numbered 0 to 16. A **plane** is a continuous group of 65536 code points.

Plane 0 (Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP), contains most commonly used characters. Planes 1 through 16 are called "supplementary planes". As of Unicode version 13.0, seven of these planes have assigned code points, and five are named.

Planes are further subdivided into **blocks**, which, unlike planes, do not have a fixed size. Unicode 13.0 defines 308 blocks, covering 26% of the possible code point space.

**Code points** are numbers that make up the codespace, usually represented with hexadecimal starting with "U+". Unicode can address ranges from `U+000000` to `U+10FFFF`, *with highest two digits identical to plane number*. Every assigned code point has various properties as well as an uppercased permanent name. For example, üòÇ (U+1F602, FACE WITH TEARS OF JOY EMOJI) lies in `Plane 1`, block `Emoticons (Emoji)`.

**Characters** may be composed _one or more_ code points, for example, the letter √© (U+00E9, LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE), can also be represented as a pair of e (U+0065, LATIN SMALL LETTER E), followed by ÃÅ (U+0301, COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT). Unicode defines several related properties and rules for text-rendering systems to render properly.

  The "Last Resort" font is used when a character is not being capable to rendered by available fonts.
